Yeah it's Lil Ugly Mane in this bitch
Tell dem boyz Ima skeleton 2011
It's the new shit, mayne, it's the new shit
I ain't got a heart, mayne
I ain't got none of that human shit, mane
I'm just a skeleton, mayne
Coming at you through da skulls and the fire
I ain't got a heart, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I ain't got a soul, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I ain't got a brain, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I just got this pistol and this chain
Boy I'm tellin 'em!
The game need a shape-up, I'm the motherfucking trapezoid
Go to sleep and never wake up, I ain't laughing boy
'Cause Imma start clappin' at 'em 'fore I'm even half annoyed
Not only did I pass the haters (Ugly Mane done lapped the boys)
Pockets on pickle, hand on the nickel
Hoes want the dollars, they can't even get a trickle
Standing in my way, I'm about to blow the whistle
Make me wanna come erry time I pull the pistol
Playaz circle murder posse gang bang
Cookin' cookies in the pots and pans, mayne
Not to be confused with the biscuits
That be rippin' up yo frame, mayne
Watch me change lanes in a Range with the dame that you claim, mayne
Trust me, that boy so ugly
Hold ya head underwater, that's what I call bubbly
Catch me with a boner and a pocket full of money
With yo girl butt-naked with my babies in her tummy
I ain't got a heart, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I ain't got a soul, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I ain't got a brain, tell dem boyz ima skeleton
I just got this pistol and this chain
Boy I'm tellin 'em!
