To them niggas that be holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To the mutherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

(One, two, shaboom, shaboom)
Now look here
I'm gon hit the club man, I'm gon get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon spend more than a dub
I'll go tell them broads and they chickenhead friends
No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm the hater of the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac, Coupe Deville, and Chicken Head Drilling

To them niggas that be holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To the motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

I'm gon get that fresh fire fade and then I'm gon get laid
Like some finger-waves on payday, my lady, you gon get paid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirtier dot has informed me
The drought has ended today
With no delay
And a four piece brizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place and a petite face to play

To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To the motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the wild kingdom, fox, minks to crocodiles
Pop tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hookline to follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind til tomorrow
They call me Mac-Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mac-Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
Its trouble all up in you, dear

To them niggas that be holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To the motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

Yes, I know how to excite them hoes
Mink coats, reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner on his mind sick
He say he love this old coke strung out stripper bitch, why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Ride with this pretty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Copone, Don Huggy Bear
Pokey the fucking pimpolous ain't that cute but slick em out them drawers
I'm so infamous, dead serious
From the club, to the caddy, to the Holiday Inn
From the dusk til the dawn we gon do it again

To them niggas that be holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To the motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor start shaking it all, yes y'all
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
