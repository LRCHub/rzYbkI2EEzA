Well I'm back up in yo ear once again 'cause I run this shit
And I want rap about it unless I done that shit
We catchin' flights to Vegas, we stay away from haters
We always chasin' paper, we ballin' like The Lakers
We steppin' out in our gators, nothin' but pimps and players
All my close taylor plus I got hoes that at bayla

I'm like Popeye the sailor 'cause I smoke me spinach
(Why?)
And when my Benz pass by they'd be like I hope he in it
They'd know my shit ain't rented because I got two
(Why? I got to)
Yeah I got blue diamonds but these yellow rocks fool

I got baguettes in the middle of my chain
H2 in the middle of the lane doin' donuts in the middle of the rain
If you in a wreck can I get a little brain
I ain't gotta spend a thing for me to hit ya dame
I smoke so much dro hoe I might forget your name
Stop don't make me cock it and pop it and reload quick
I'm like Bone Crusher I ain't never scared bitch

I'm into makin' bread bitch and ridin' candy red shit
I'm doin' this for pimp C and my nigga head bitch
'Cause when the feds hit I don't wanna be around
I'm a be real with you, I don't wanna be in town
'Cause when I'm on the road, I'm gettin' more dough
(Road, dough)
I'm gettin' unreleased, Jordans straight from Tokyo

Yo chain shinin' in the day but look at mine when it's night
You see the difference in the rocks, they look like blocks
Red, white, and blue diamonds got me lookin' like the cops
